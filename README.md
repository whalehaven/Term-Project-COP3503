<h3> All classes should have both .cpp and .h files, with delcarations in the header and implementations in the cpp file. Once all classes have been created, we will schedule a full group meet up to determine how inheritance should be organized and to debug/fix errors (probably friday or saturday). Let's continue to be in discord in case anyone needs help.

## Hi everyone!
**The program now compliles and builds.** Use the command:  

`g++ -o main -Wall -std=c++11 builder.cpp controller.cpp word.cpp`    

to create a file named "main" and run it with    

`./main`    

This only works on a Unix system.

### Full list of classes:
1. Builder(main) :heavy_check_mark:
2. Controller :heavy_check_mark:
3. Word (with WordList and WordBank linked lists) :heavy_check_mark:
4. FunctionWord (and following subclasses):
   - Conjunction 
   - Preposition 
5. ContentWord (and following subclasses):
   - Noun
   - Verb
   - Adjective
   - Adverb

#### All classes should have both .cpp and .h files, with delcarations in the header and implementations in the cpp file. Once all classes have been created, we will schedule a full group meet up to determine how inheritance should be organized and to debug/fix errors (probably friday or saturday). Let's continue to be in discord in case anyone needs help.
